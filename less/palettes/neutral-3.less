// Neutral-3 Palette
// Palette with three shades of neutral colors: white, black an gray.
//
// White and black colors are absolutely defined. But the gray color is
// calculated by interpolation of these colors.

@colors: white, black, gray;

// base
@color-white:           #fff;
@color-black:           #000;

// computed
@color-gray:            hsv(
                            (hsvhue(@color-white) + hsvhue(@color-black)) / 2,
                            (hsvsaturation(@color-white) + hsvsaturation(@color-black)) / 2,
                            (hsvvalue(@color-white) + hsvvalue(@color-black)) / 2
                        );
